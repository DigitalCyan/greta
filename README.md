The name is not an acronym it's a ironic refrence to everyone's favorite eco warrior since this app is all about 
the economy of your carbon footprint in HighFleet, which is a game in which poeple decided that flying 
oilrigs is the right way to do war. And some of the values in the game are insane. I plugged them into some formulas to 
check how expensive would it be to travel around using the machines from the game and got equally insane prices. This app 
is the result of said "research", I'll probably add more ships in the future. If I don't, feel free to make a PR.
